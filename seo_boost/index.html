        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of improving a website's visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). It involves optimizing various elements of a website, such as content, meta tags, site structure, and backlinks, to make it more relevant and authoritative in the eyes of search engines like Google and Bing. The goal of SEO is to bring more organic search traffic to your website by ranking higher for a wider variety of keywords. </p>

        <dt><a href="#" class="accordionTitle">Why should I hire an SEO agency for my website?</a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>Google’s search algorithm is continually changing, and winning at SEO means responding to those changes when they impact your site. SEO agencies like ours bring specialized tools, knowledge and expertise to your optimization efforts, so you can make bigger strides in your search visibility and rankings with less wasted effort. This can be especially important for e-commerce and B2B businesses that conduct a majority of their business online.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="#" class="accordionTitle">Does SEO even matter anymore? </a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            Yes, and more so today, when so much of the customer discovery process occurs online. Ranking higher in search results can significantly impact your online visibility, brand awareness and customer acquisition prospects. If your page doesn’t appear within the first few pages on a brand-connected search, you essentially don’t exist to the more than half of shoppers who use Google to discover new brands. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Changes to Google’s processing capabilities through the years have also made it necessary to take a comprehensive, holistic view of SEO. Gone are the days when you could stuff keywords onto a page and make it rank—Google is now assessing your site’s authority and trustworthiness, and serving up the most contextual results to users, even if their search keywords don’t appear on your page. Paying attention to dozens of on-page, off-page and technical components of SEO is harder, but ultimately leads to more success long-term.

        <dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#">Can you get my website to number 1 for [keyword term]?</a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            Achieving the number 1 ranking for a specific keyword term is never guaranteed, as it depends on various factors such as the competitiveness of the keyword, the quality of your website and content, and the SEO efforts of your competitors. SEO aims to improve your website's visibility and ranking on search engine results pages, but reaching the top spot requires a combination of strategic optimization, high-quality content, relevant backlinks, and consistent effort. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We can help optimize your website and develop a tailored strategy to improve your rankings, but it's important to set realistic expectations based on the specific keyword and competitive landscape. Be skeptical of anyone who promises you a number 1 ranking, as they’re probably not being honest with you.

        <dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#">What are the most important parts of SEO?</a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            The most important parts of SEO include keyword research, on-page optimization, technical SEO, and link building. <strong>Keyword research</strong> helps identify the terms and phrases people use to search for information related to your business. <strong>On-page optimization</strong> involves optimizing the website's content, meta tags, headers, and URLs to make it more relevant and understandable to both users and search engines. <strong>Technical SEO</strong> focuses on improving the website's performance, accessibility, and indexability. <strong>Link building</strong> involves acquiring high-quality backlinks from reputable websites, which can enhance your website's authority and improve its search rankings.

        <dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#">How does SEO fit into my digital marketing strategy?</a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            SEO should be a foundational part of your digital marketing strategy. It helps drive organic traffic to your website, improves your overall visibility, and gives you deeper insight into your customers and competitive set. By implementing the latest SEO techniques, you can increase the chances of your website appearing in relevant search results and attract potential customers who are actively searching for products or services similar to yours. SEO can align with other digital marketing efforts, such as content marketing, social media marketing, and paid advertising, creating a cohesive online presence.

        <dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#">What is Domain Authority?</a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            Domain authority is a proprietary website ranking score from 1-100, originally developed by SEO consultant Moz, that predicts how likely a website is to rank in search engine result pages. It’s built off the fact that search engines use the quantity and quality of your website’s inbound links to determine your site’s overall “authority.” They then prioritize sites with more authority in search results. The higher your website's score, the more likely you are to rank within the first page of Google. This score can be used to evaluate how effective your SEO presence is, and can be a perfect jumping off point when crafting your broader SEO strategy.

        <dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#">How do you determine the quality of my site’s current backlinks?</a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            We use multiple tools including SEMRush, Google’s GA4 and Google Search Console to analyze the backlinks to your website, and evaluate them on several factors. Those include the authority and relevance of the linking domain, the anchor text used, the overall link profile, and the diversity of your sources. Quality backlinks come from reputable websites that are relevant to your industry or niche. They should be natural and earned through legitimate means, rather than being artificially created. “Toxic backlinks” come from questionable websites or show evidence of unnatural creation, and can actively harm your SEO profile.

        <dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#">How can I build more and/or better backlinks? </a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            There are several strategies to build more backlinks for your website. One effective approach is to create high-quality and valuable content that naturally attracts links from other websites. You can also work to build relationships with relevant websites and influencers in your industry through things like guest posts, collaborations and interviews. Leveraging social media platforms and content promotion strategies can also help increase the visibility of your content and attract more backlinks. We can help design a specific strategy that fits your business and industry.

        <dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#">Do you use AI in your SEO work? </a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            We do when it’s appropriate and suited for the task at hand. There are many rote tasks in the SEO field that can be accelerated, from generating lists of keyword permutations or writing similar meta descriptions at scale, and we definitely welcome that. By using AI in certain stages of the process, our experts are freed to interpret data, research and experiment with variables, and make more informed decisions. Any work performed by AI is double-checked by our team members to catch incorrect content.

        <dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#">How can smaller businesses benefit from SEO? </a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            It’s not just for big enterprises—SEO gives smaller businesses the chance to compete with more established brands right where users are looking. By targeting niche keywords and local search queries, smaller businesses can attract relevant and targeted traffic to their websites. SEO can also help improve brand visibility, build credibility and trust with potential customers, and increase organic traffic and conversions. It’s a cost-effective marketing strategy that offers long-term benefits, considering that organic traffic is essentially free after your initial investment. 
          </p>

        <dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#">How long will it take to see results from SEO work?</a></dt>
        <dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
          <p>
            The time it takes to see results from your SEO work can depend on a variety of factors, from the competitiveness of your industry to the current state of your website’s optimization. A site that has had no attention paid to its SEO will be easier to boost than an existing site with SEO strategies already in place. Generally speaking, it may take several months to see a notable improvement in your search positioning, but it’s important to know that SEO is a long-term game that never ends. Staying competitive online means optimizing continuously and responding to changes that occur.
