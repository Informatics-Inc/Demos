        <p>Gabrielle is 20 years old and works as a preschool teacher in North Liberty. Looking recently for a place to live, a Summit View manufactured home community resident suggested she buy her own manufactured or mobile home.  Gabrielle lived in Summit View in Cedar Rapids as a child, and already loved the community.  She has happy memories of playing outdoors with other kids and feels safe in Summit View.</p>
        <p>Gabrielle filled out an online financing application at www.hameshomes.com/financing.  Hames sales person Clint Aldeman called her back quickly and said that with a 10% down payment, her best option is a 10 year fixed-rate loan with Hames’ in-house financing company[I].  Clint explained that her loan payment plus home site rent would be at, or lower, than Cedar Rapids’ average $750 monthly 2-bedroom apartment cost.  </p>
        <p>Clint and Gabrielle toured manufactured homes for sale that fit her lifestyle and budget.  The sales process was “super smooth,” she reflects.  She selected a two bedroom, two bathroom fully-refurbished manufactured home with almost 1100 square feet of living space. “I’m able to own my own home. I have control over my space.  I don’t have to wait for a landlord to come and fix something,” Gabrielle explains.</p>
        <img src="img/feature-blog.jpg" />
        <p>And it’s still a wonderful place to live.  Gabrielle adds, “Neighbors helping neighbors really came out during the [August 10 derecho] storm.  I know I can reach out to neighbors if needed, and they can get hold of me, too.”</p>
        <p>Now Gabrielle has lots of room, her own yard, and a small mortgage.  Best of all, she’ll own her home when she’s 30 years old!</p>
